# The AI Landscape for Beginners — Pre-Read



## What You’ll Learn
In this pre-read, you’ll discover:
- How **traditional software** is different from **AI systems**
- What **AI**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Generative AI (GenAI)** really mean
- How AI evolved from simple rules to powerful learning systems
- Where you already see AI in everyday life
- What direction AI is heading in the future

This pre-read is designed to **orient you**, not overwhelm you.  
You don’t need any prior AI knowledge.



## What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Let’s start with something familiar.

Think about a **calculator** and a **music streaming app**.

- A calculator gives answers only when you tell it exactly what to do  
- A music app learns what you like and recommends new songs automatically  

That learning ability is the key difference.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is when machines learn from data and make decisions, instead of following only fixed rules written by humans.



## Traditional Software vs AI Systems

### Traditional Software (Rule-Based Thinking)

Traditional software works by following instructions step by step.

Input → Fixed rules written by humans → Output

Example:
If temperature > 30 → Turn on fan
Else → Keep fan off

Characteristics:
- Humans write every rule
- No learning happens
- Same input always gives the same output

This works well for **simple and predictable tasks**.



### AI Systems (Learning-Based Thinking)

AI systems work differently.

Input data → Learning process → Model → Decision

Instead of writing rules, we give examples.  
The system learns patterns from those examples.

Example:
- Show many temperature and usage records
- The system learns when people prefer the fan on
- It adapts to different conditions automatically

## Why Do We Need AI?

Writing rules for every situation is impossible in the real world.

AI matters because it can:

1. **Handle complexity**  
   Example: Recognizing faces or voices

2. **Improve with experience**  
   Example: Recommendations getting better over time

3. **Adapt to change**  
   Example: Detecting new types of spam or fraud

These problems are difficult or impossible to solve using only rules.



## AI, Machine Learning, and Generative AI (Big Picture)

These terms are often confusing. Let’s simplify them.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
↓
Machine Learning (ML)
↓
Generative AI (GenAI)

- **AI** is the overall goal: making machines intelligent  
- **ML** is the method: learning from data  
- **GenAI** is a type of ML that creates new content  

Easy way to remember:
AI = The goal
ML = The learning method
GenAI = The creator



## A Very Short History of AI

AI did not suddenly become powerful. It evolved slowly.

1950s–1980s → Rule-Based AI
1990s–2010s → Machine Learning Era
2020s–Present → Generative AI Era

Why AI improved recently:
- Huge amounts of data
- Faster and cheaper computers
- Better learning algorithms



## Where You Already See AI

You interact with AI more often than you think.

You use an app
↓
AI learns from behavior
↓
AI suggests actions

Common examples:
- Netflix and YouTube recommendations
- Google Maps traffic prediction
- Face unlock on smartphones
- Chatbots answering questions

## The Road Ahead

AI is moving toward working **with humans**, not replacing them.

Humans + AI
↓
Better decisions
↓
Higher productivity
↓
Responsible and ethical use

Future AI will focus on:
- Assisting humans
- Personalization
- Transparency and ethics



## Think About It

- Is a calculator an AI system? Why or why not?
- Which app you use daily might be learning from you?
- What task would you like AI to help you with?



## Key Takeaways

- Traditional software follows fixed rules
- AI systems learn patterns from data
- AI, ML, and GenAI are closely related
- AI is already part of everyday life
- The future of AI is collaborative
